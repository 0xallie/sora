# Sora

Multi-functional Discord bot

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.9 or newer
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
3. (Optional) Run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
4. Run `poetry install`

If you don't want to use Poetry for some reason, you can also just install with `pip install -e .`.

## Running
Run with `poetry run sora`.

You can also run `.venv/bin/sora` directly, for example if you want to run the bot as a systemd service.
